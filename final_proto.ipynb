    "    - Place of Departure (city, country)\n",
    "    - Destination\n",
    "    - Travel Dates (schedule)\n",
    "    - Accommodation\n",
    "    - Activities (things to do)\n",
    "    - Budget\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use the Chain-of-Thought method by completing each task step-by-step, explicitly reasoning at each step. Provide a few-shot example for guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step-by-Step Instruction:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 1: Mandatory Information Collection\n",
    "    First, ask the user explicitly:\n",
    "    \"Please tell me your place of departure (city and country). This is mandatory information to start planning your itinerary.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: The itinerary cannot be planned without knowing the starting location. Ensure the user provides this information clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Few-shot Example:\n",
    "    Agent: Please tell me your place of departure (city and country). This is mandatory information.\n",
    "    User: Boston, USA\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 2: Collect Additional Travel Information (with Recommendations)\n",
    "    Next, sequentially ask the user for destination, travel dates, and expected budget. When asking each question, always provide 3 recommendation options.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: Providing options helps users make quicker and informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Few-shot Example:\n",
    "    Agent: Where would you like to travel? Here are three popular recommendations:\n",
    "    1. San Francisco, USA\n",
    "    2. New York City, USA\n",
    "    3. Miami, USA\n",
    "    User: I'd like to go to San Francisco, USA.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Agent: Great choice! What dates are you planning for your travel? Here are three recommended timeframes:\n",
    "    1. May 20 - May 27\n",
    "    2. June 10 - June 17\n",
    "    3. July 15 - July 22\n",
    "    User: June 10 - June 17\n",
    "\n",
    "    Agent: What's your expected budget for the entire trip? Here are three typical budget ranges:\n",
    "    1. Economy: $1,000 - $1,500\n",
    "    2. Moderate: $1,500 - $2,500\n",
    "    3. Luxury: $2,500+\n",
    "    User: Moderate, around $2,000\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 3: Generate Activities and Accommodations\n",
    "    Now, you must use the attraction recommender to produce a list of attractions the user approves.\n",
    "    Then, give the approved list to the attraction link finder and request it to search for them one by one, only accept the search\n",
    "    results as links. Save the links. Then, using the destination, ask the hotel link finder to find appropriate accomodations and flights links\n",
    "    Only accept the name and link of the results. Save the links and pass flight links to flight finder, pass hotel links to\n",
    "    finder for flights.Pass the generated links to activity pricer and ask it to go through it one by one.\n",
    "    Save all information regarding pricing and pass to budget checker.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: To provide accurate recommendations, you need to align activities and accommodations with the user's budget and interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Few-shot Example:\n",
    "    Agent Search Criteria:\n",
    "    - Destination: San Francisco, USA\n",
    "    - Dates: June 10 - June 17\n",
    "    - Budget: Moderate (~$2,000)\n",
    "    - Activities: Popular tourist spots, cultural experiences\n",
    "    - Accommodations: Mid-range hotels or Airbnb\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sample Agent Output:\n",
    "    Activities:\n",
    "    1. Visit Golden Gate Bridge (Free)\n",
    "    2. Alcatraz Island Tour ($40)\n",
    "    3. Exploratorium ($30)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Accommodation Recommendation:\n",
    "    1. Holiday Inn Golden Gateway ($180/night)\n",
    "    2. Airbnb near Fisherman's Wharf ($150/night)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 4: Calculate and Present Budget Clearly\n",
    "    Calculate the total expected cost based on accommodation, activities, transportation, and daily expenses clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: Users appreciate transparency and a clear breakdown of expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Few-shot Example:\n",
    "    Budget Breakdown:\n",
    "    - Flights (Round-trip): $400\n",
    "    - Accommodation (7 nights x $150): $1,050\n",
    "    - Activities: $70\n",
    "    - Meals and Miscellaneous: $400\n",
    "    - Total: ~$1,920\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 5: Final Travel Plan Summary\n",
    "    Provide a concise and comprehensive summary of the travel itinerary, then send to schedule making agent for final itinerary.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: Summaries help users quickly understand and confirm the overall plan.\n",

      "    \"Please tell me your place of departure (city and country). This is mandatory information to start planning your itinerary.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "    Reasoning: The itinerary cannot be planned without knowing the starting location. Ensure the user provides this information clearly.\n",

      "\n",
      "#### **2. FACTS TO LOOK UP**  \n",
      "- **Accommodations:**  \n",
      "  - Need direct booking links for **luxury hotels under $3,000 total for 7 nights** (e.g., The Ritz-Carlton, Four Seasons, The Peninsula).  \n",
      "  - Current challenge: Booking.com/TripAdvisor links require further scraping for exact prices.  \n",
      "- **Flights:**  \n",
      "  - Round-trip from **Providence (PVD) to NYC (JFK/LGA)** for May 20–27.  \n",
      "  - Expected price range: **$300–$600** (based on proximity and season).  \n",
      "- **Activity Pricing:**  \n",
      "  - Helicopter tours: **~$200–$400/person**  \n",
      "  - Broadway VIP tickets: **$300–$800/seat**  \n",

      "#### **4. EDUCATED GUESSES (UPDATED)**  \n",
      "- **Accommodations:**  \n",
      "  - **The Langham, NYC** or **Baccarat Hotel** likely fit the budget (~$400/night).  \n",
      "  - Reasoning: Luxury hotels in NYC average $300–$600/night; $285/night is achievable for 7 nights.  \n",
      "- **Flights:**  \n",
      "  - **Providence to NYC flights are cheaper than Boston-NYC** (~$200 round-trip on Delta/JetBlue).  \n",
      "  - Reasoning: Shorter distance = lower cost; May is shoulder season (not peak summer).  \n",
      "- **Dining:**  \n",
      "  - **Michelin-starred tasting menus will dominate the activity budget** (e.g., Masa is ~$600/person).  \n",

      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Key Adjustments and Learnings**  \n",
      "1. **Providence Departure:** Flights are cheaper than Boston, freeing up budget for activities.  \n",
      "2. **Luxury Hotels:** Need to focus on **direct links** (e.g., hotel websites) to bypass aggregator paywalls.  \n",
      "3. **Activity Costs:** Helicopter/Broadway/dining will consume ~50% of budget; prioritize user preferences.  \n",
      "\n",
      "### **Next Steps**  \n",
      "- **Re-attempt hotel search** using specific names (e.g., \"The Langham NYC official site May 20–27\").  \n",
      "- **Find flights** from PVD to JFK/LGA for the dates.  \n",
      "- **Confirm activity pricing** via official sites (e.g., Statue Liberty VIP tours).  \n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you’d like to proceed with any of these adjustments!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Root Cause of Failure**  \n",
      "1. **Hotel Search Issues:**  \n",
      "   - Repeated queries to aggregator sites (Booking.com/TripAdvisor) returned incomplete price data or required manual clicks.  \n",
      "   - No direct links to official hotel sites were provided, causing budget validation delays.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Activity Pricing Gaps:**  \n",
      "   - Approved attractions lacked immediate price verification, risking budget overruns.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Flight Data Missing:**  \n",
      "   - Flights weren’t searched for early, leaving a blind spot in the budget.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **New Plan (Revised Workflow)**  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 1: Refined Hotel Search**  \n",
      "- **HotelLinkFinder:**  \n",
      "  - Query **specific luxury hotels** (e.g., \"The Langham NYC official booking May 20–27\") to bypass aggregators.  \n",
      "  - **Hint:** Use terms like \"official site\" or \"direct booking\" in searches.  \n",
      "  - Return **direct booking links + nightly rates** (e.g., \"$450/night\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 2: Flight Search**  \n",
      "- **FlightLinkFinder:**  \n",
      "  - Search **\"PVD to JFK round-trip flights May 20–27 2023\"** immediately.  \n",
      "  - Prioritize airlines’ official sites (Delta/JetBlue) for accurate pricing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 3: Activity Pricing**  \n",
      "- **AttractionLinkFinder → ActivityPricer:**  \n",
      "  - For each approved activity (e.g., Statue Liberty VIP), extract:  \n",
      "    - **Official ticket link** (e.g., statuecruises.com).  \n",
      "    - **ActivityPricer** scrapes prices from the exact page (e.g., \"$40–$80\").  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 4: Budget Validation**  \n",
      "- **BudgetController:**  \n",
      "  - Sum: **Flights + Hotels (7 nights) + Activities**.  \n",
      "  - If over $3,000: Adjust activities (e.g., skip spa) or hotel tier.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 5: Itinerary Finalization**  \n",
      "- **ScheduleMaker:**  \n",
      "  - Group activities by **proximity** (e.g., Statue Liberty + One World on same day).  \n",
      "  - Allocate meals near Michelin restaurants (e.g., Le Bernardin after Broadway).  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",

      "  5. Michelin-Starred Dining (e.g., Le Bernardin)  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **2. FACTS TO LOOK UP**  \n",
      "- **Accommodations:**  \n",
      "  - **New Strategy:** Target boutique luxury hotels (e.g., **The Beekman**, **The Whitby**) instead of chains.  \n",
      "    - *Why?* Boutique hotels often offer better rates for luxury amenities in NYC.  \n",
      "  - **Action:** Search \"boutique luxury hotels NYC official site May 20–27\".  \n",

      "   - *Reasoning:* Sunset slots are premium; recommend midday to save budget.  \n",
      "2. **Hotel Location Trade-off:**  \n",
      "   - **Guess:** Staying in **Lower Manhattan** (near One World Observatory) saves transit time/costs vs. Midtown.  \n",
      "   - *Reasoning:* Proximity to Statue Liberty + One World reduces Uber fares.  \n",
      "3. **Dining Reservations:**  \n",

      "2. **Boutique Hotels > Chains:**  \n",
      "   - Often better luxury value (e.g., The Beekman’s rooftop bar included).  \n",
      "3. **Activity Timing Matters:**  \n",
      "   - Sunset tours/peak Broadway shows inflate costs; recommend off-peak slots.  \n",

      "#### **6. NEXT STEPS**  \n",
      "1. **Hotels:** Search \"The Beekman NYC official booking May 20–27\".  \n",
      "2. **Flights:** Book Delta PVD→JFK (found $278 round-trip).  \n",

      "2. **No Parallel Processing:**  \n",
      "   - Searches for flights, hotels, and activities were sequential, delaying budget validation.  \n",

      "\n",
      "#### **Step 2: Parallel Searches**  \n",
      "- **Simultaneously:**  \n",
      "  - AttractionLinkFinder fetches **official activity links** (e.g., \"Statue Liberty Crown Access official tickets\").  \n",
      "  - ActivityPricer extracts prices **from official pages only** (e.g., statuecruises.com).  \n",
      "\n",

      "- **BudgetController:**  \n",
      "  - Pre-validate costs:  \n",
      "    - Reject hotels >$300/night or flights >$400.  \n",

      "\n",
      "#### **Step 4: Adaptive Scheduling**  \n",

      "  - Group activities by **proximity** (e.g., Statue Liberty + One World same day).  \n",
      "  - Allocate Michelin meals near Broadway shows.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 5: Fail-Safes**  \n",
      "- **If links fail:**  \n",
      "  - Fallback to \"*[Hotel Name] direct booking contact*\" (e.g., callable phone number).  \n",

      "\n",
      "#### **2. FACTS TO LOOK UP**  \n",
      "- **Accommodations:**  \n",
      "  - **Updated Strategy:** Prioritize hotels with **free cancellation** and **included amenities** (e.g., breakfast, Wi-Fi).  \n",
      "    - *Why?* Reduces risk if plans change and improves value.  \n",

      "1. **Activity Bundling:**  \n",
      "   - **Guess:** Booking Statue Liberty + One World as a combo tour saves **10–15%**.  \n",

      "#### **6. NEXT STEPS**  \n",

      "- Added **free cancellation** as a hotel priority (reduces risk).  \n",
      "- Highlighted **midweek savings** for flights/activities.  \n",
      "- Introduced **activity bundling** and **hotel perks** as new cost-saving strategies.  \n",
      "- Added **flight delay data** to timing recommendations.  \n",
      "\n",

      "Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Root Cause of Failure**  \n",
      "1. **Sequential Workflow Bottleneck**  \n",
      "   - Searches for flights, hotels, and activities happened one after another, delaying budget validation and causing timeouts.  \n",
      "2. **Overly Broad Queries**  \n",
      "   - Generic searches (e.g., \"luxury hotels NYC\") returned irrelevant results, requiring manual filtering.  \n",
      "3. **Missed Direct Links**  \n",
      "   - Relied on aggregators (e.g., Booking.com) instead of official sites, leading to incomplete pricing or dead ends.  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **New Plan (Optimized Workflow)**  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 1: Parallel Searches**  \n",
      "- **Simultaneously trigger:**  \n",
      "  - `FlightLinkFinder`: Query *\"Delta PVD to JFK round-trip May 20–27 2023 official site\"* (include airline + exact dates).  \n",
      "  - `HotelLinkFinder`: Query *\"The Beekman NYC official booking May 20–27 free cancellation\"* (prioritize boutique hotels).  \n",
      "  - `AttractionLinkFinder`: Query *\"Statue of Liberty Crown Access official tickets\"* (one query per approved activity).  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 2: Precise Queries**  \n",
      "- **Add mandatory filters to all searches:**  \n",
      "  - Flights: Include *\"nonstop\"* and *\"free cancellation\"*.  \n",
      "  - Hotels: Include *\"free WiFi + breakfast\"* and *\"walking distance to [top activity]\"*.  \n",
      "  - Activities: Use *\"official site\"* and *\"VIP/priority access\"* for luxury tier.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 3: Budget Pre-Check**  \n",
      "- **`BudgetController` intervenes early:**  \n",
      "  - Reject any flight >$400, hotel >$300/night, or activity >$150 without approval.  \n",
      "  - If any item exceeds limits, auto-substitute:  \n",
      "    - Swap Broadway for *Sleep No More* (off-Broadway, ~$120).  \n",
      "    - Replace Michelin dining with **James Beard Award** restaurants.  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 4: Direct Link Validation**  \n",
      "- **`ActivityPricer` only processes:**  \n",
      "  - Official attraction pages (e.g., statuecruises.com).  \n",
      "  - Hotel/flight links ending in `.com` or `.org` (no aggregators).  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Step 5: Adaptive Scheduling**  \n",
      "- **`ScheduleMaker` groups by proximity:**  \n",
      "  - Day 1: Statue Liberty + One World (same area).  \n",
      "  - Day 2: Broadway + Michelin dining (theater district).  \n",
      "\n",
      "#### **Fail-Safes**  \n",
      "- **If links fail:**  \n",
      "  - Fallback to *\"[Activity Name] customer service phone number\"* for direct booking.  \n",
      "- **If budget exceeds:**  \n",
      "  - Drop helicopter tour for **High Line + rooftop bar** ($0 vs. $250).  \n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "### **Key Improvements**  \n",
      "✅ **Parallel processing** → Faster results.  \n",
      "✅ **Hard filters** → Fewer irrelevant links.  \n",
      "✅ **Early budget caps** → Prevent overruns.  \n",
      "✅ **Proximity scheduling** → Minimize transit costs.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Execution Order:**  \n",
      "1. Launch parallel searches (flights/hotels/activities).  \n",
      "2. Validate prices against budget.  \n",
