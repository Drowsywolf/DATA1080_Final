      "\n",
      "1. **GIVEN OR VERIFIED FACTS**  \n",
      "   - A travel itinerary is being requested.\n",
      "   - The itinerary needs to include the place of departure, destination, travel dates, accommodation, activities, and budget.\n",
      "   - The user needs to provide their place of departure, which is mandatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **FACTS TO LOOK UP**  \n",
      "   - Options for destinations that might be appealing to various travelers based on different interests (cultural, adventure, relaxation).\n",
      "   - Accommodation options and availability for specific destinations during proposed travel dates.\n",
      "   - Activities available in recommended destinations that align with the user's interests.\n",
      "   - Potential costs associated with accommodations, activities, and travel (flights, local transport).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **FACTS TO DERIVE**  \n",
      "   - Suitable travel dates considering typical work and holiday patterns of travelers.\n",
      "   - Estimated budget ranges based on average costs for accommodation, activities, and dining in proposed destinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **EDUCATED GUESSES**  \n",
      "   - Popular travel destinations might include Paris, Tokyo, and New York based on general trends.\n",
      "   - Accommodations can vary widely in price depending on the destination and time of year, often ranging from budget to luxury options.\n",
      "   - Activities might vary considerably in cost depending on the type (free tours, museum entry fees, adventure sports, etc.) and location.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Here is the plan to follow as best as possible:\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Step 1: User Engagement**\n",
      "  - Directly ask the user for their place of departure (city, country) and ensure they provide a response.\n",
      "  \n",
      "- **Step 2: Destination Inquiry**\n",
      "  - Once the place of departure is confirmed, ask the user for their desired travel destination.\n",
      "  - Provide three destination options based on common travel interests (cultural, adventure, relaxation).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Step 3: Travel Dates & Budget**\n",
      "  - Ask the user for their preferred travel dates, providing options (e.g., a weekend, a week, or a specific month).\n",
      "  - Inquire about the expected budget, offering three budget ranges (e.g., budget-friendly, mid-range, luxury).\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Step 4: Delegate Tasks to WebSurfers**\n",
      "  - Assign WebSurfer1 to find activities in the chosen destination, including booking fees.\n",
      "  - Assign WebSurfer2 to search for accommodation options in the same destination with their respective booking fees.\n",
      "  - Assign WebSurfer3 to explore flight options or other travel methods with the relevant booking fees.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Step 5: Compile Information**\n",
      "  - As the information is gathered by the web surfing agents, the Assistant compiles the options for activities, accommodation, and travel into a cohesive plan.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Step 6: Present Itinerary**\n",
      "  - Present the user with a finalized travel itinerary that includes their departure city, chosen destination, travel dates, accommodation options, activities, and total budget with potential costs.\n",
