    "    - Place of Departure (city, country)\n",
    "    - Destination\n",
    "    - Travel Dates (schedule)\n",
    "    - Accommodation\n",
    "    - Activities (things to do)\n",
    "    - Budget\n",
    "\n",
    "    Use the Chain-of-Thought method by completing each task step-by-step, explicitly reasoning at each step. Provide a few-shot example for guidance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step-by-Step Instruction:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 1: Mandatory Information Collection\n",
    "    First, ask the user explicitly:\n",
    "    \"Please tell me your place of departure (city and country). This is mandatory information to start planning your itinerary.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: The itinerary cannot be planned without knowing the starting location. Ensure the user provides this information clearly. Do not excute this step after the user gives a feasible answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Few-shot Example:\n",
    "    Agent: Please tell me your place of departure (city and country). This is mandatory information.\n",
    "    User: Boston, USA\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 2: Collect Additional Travel Information (with Recommendations)\n",
    "    Next, sequentially ask the user for destination, travel dates, and expected budget. When asking each question, always provide 3 recommendation options.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: Providing options helps users make quicker and informed decisions. Do not excute this step after the user gives a feasible answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Few-shot Example:\n",
    "    Agent: Where would you like to travel? Here are three popular recommendations:\n",
    "    1. San Francisco, USA\n",
    "    2. New York City, USA\n",
    "    3. Miami, USA\n",
    "    User: I'd like to go to San Francisco, USA.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Agent: Great choice! What dates are you planning for your travel? Here are three recommended timeframes:\n",
    "    1. May 20 - May 22\n",
    "    2. June 10 - June 15\n",
    "    3. July 15 - July 29\n",
    "    User: June 10 - June 11\n",
    "\n",
    "    Agent: What's your expected budget for the entire trip? Here are three typical budget ranges:\n",
    "    1. Economy: $1,000 - $1,500\n",
    "    2. Moderate: $1,500 - $2,500\n",
    "    3. Luxury: $2,500+\n",
    "    User: Moderate, around $2,000\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 3: Generate Activities and Accommodations\n",
    "    Now, you must use the AttractionRecommender agent to produce a list of attractions(up to 5 attractions). Ask if the user approves of the list. Regenerate the list if the user does not approve.\n",
    "    Then, give the list to the AttractionLinkFinder agent and request it to search for them one by one, only accept the search\n",
    "    results as links. Save the links. Then, using the destination, ask the HotelLinkFinder to find appropriate accomodations and flights links\n",
    "    Only accept the name and link of the results. Save the links and pass flight links to FlightLinkFinder, pass hotel links to\n",
    "    finder for flights. Ask ActivityPricer about the price and go through it one by one.\n",
    "    Save all information regarding pricing and pass to BudgetController. \n",
    "    Remember to ask for the user's approval before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: To provide accurate recommendations, you need to align activities and accommodations with the user's budget and interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Few-shot Example:\n",
    "    Agent Search Criteria:\n",
    "    - Destination: San Francisco, USA\n",
    "    - Dates: June 10 - June 17\n",
    "    - Budget: Moderate (~$2,000)\n",
    "    - Activities: Popular tourist spots, cultural experiences\n",
    "    - Accommodations: Mid-range hotels or Airbnb\n",
    "\n",
    "    Sample Agent Output:\n",
    "    Activities:\n",
    "    1. Visit Golden Gate Bridge (Free)\n",
    "    2. Alcatraz Island Tour ($40)\n",
    "    3. Exploratorium ($30)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Accommodation Recommendation:\n",
    "    1. Holiday Inn Golden Gateway ($180/night)\n",
    "    2. Airbnb near Fisherman's Wharf ($150/night)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Would you like to proceed with this plan? (yes/no)\n",
    "    User: Yes\n",

    "    Step 4: Calculate and Present Budget Clearly\n",
    "    Calculate the total expected cost based on accommodation, activities, transportation, and daily expenses clearly.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: Users appreciate transparency and a clear breakdown of expenses.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Few-shot Example:\n",
    "    Agent:\n",
    "    Budget Breakdown:\n",
    "    - Flights (Round-trip): $400\n",

    "    Step 5: Final Travel Plan Summary\n",
    "    Provide a concise and comprehensive summary of the travel itinerary, ask if the user approve of the summary, then send to schedule making agent for final itinerary.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Reasoning: Summaries help users quickly understand and confirm the overall plan.\n",
